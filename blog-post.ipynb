    "In this project, we will work to identify a composer of classical music. More specifically, we will identify whether a piece of classical music is Beethoven or not. In order to accomplish this, we will be using a data set with audio files of songs from different composers and metadata about those songs. Through strategic feature selection and potentially deep learning, we hope to yield successful results, in that our model is able to correctly classify whether a piece of music is Beethoven's at least 80-85% of the time given that there's a labeling error rate of 4% in our data set.
