    "In this project, we will work to identify a composer of classical music. More specifically, we will identify whether a piece of classical music is Beethoven or not. In order to accomplish this, we will be using a data set with audio files of songs from different composers and metadata about those songs. Through strategic feature selection and potentially deep learning, we hope to yield successful results, in that our model is able to correctly classify whether a piece of music is Beethoven's at least 80-85% of the time given that there's a labeling error rate of 4% in our data set.

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When listening to music, it's common to encounter an unfamiliar song that one wishes to quickly identify. To address this challenge, our project leverages the MusicNet dataset to classify classical music and classify whether a given piece is composed by Beethoven. This project aimed to tackle this seemingly small but persistent issue of identifying music, with the hope of contributing to the larger problem of identifying unknown music, which is beyond our current capabilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since composers may experiment and deviate from their established patterns in their music, there is no guarentee that there will be patterns in artists music audio files, thus aren't many resources on how others within the Machine Learning field addressed this problem. On the other hand, genre classification using music audio files is a widely explored problem with numerous approaches available. @costa2017evaluation used the ISMIR 2004 Database, a western music collection, the LMD database, a collection of Latin American music, and a collection of field recordings of ethnic African music to train a model to classify music genres. They found that the spectrograms of audio when used with a convolutional neural network performs just as well if not better than individual classifiers trained with visual representation on all datasets. @khamees2021classifying used the GTZAN dataset for music classification. In their studies, they created and compared the performance of CNN and RNN models. They found that CNN with Max-Pooling outperformed RNN with LSTM, yielding a testing accuracy of 74%, although it took longer. @kakarla2022recurrent also used the GTZAN dataset, worked with the MFCCs of audio files, and found that a 5-layed stacked independent RNN was able to achieve 84% accuracy. \n",

    "While our project may not be as complex as music genre classification, we used this research as guidance and created a variety of simple CNNs and RNNs with LSTM to work towards this problem of classifying the composer of classical music. "

    "\n",
    "As avid music listeners, we were drawn to the idea of creating a project focused on analyzing music using its audio files. Our project, which works to classify a piece of classical music as Beethoven or not, could potentially be used by music theory researchers, classical music listeners, and anyone interested in exploring this genre. If we kept the labels indicating the original composer rather than changing it to \"Other,\" we could potentially identify patterns and influences among different composers. It's also important to note that our models were only trained on classical music from Western composers, excluding non-Western composers and potentially perpetuate inequalities in the music industry. Misclassifications could also result in the improper attribution of credit to certain composers. While our project is still small in scale, we recognize that as it grows, it may require additional computational resources, which could introduce environmental concerns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While our project can do a better job of incorporating classical music from non-Western composers, we still believe that it could bring joy and value to the world of classical music. "
