# Process 

## Downloaded Data and Researched Approaches
- Kaggle.com 

## Determined Environment/Workflow 
- Google Drive: Holds our data because not enough disk space on computers 
- Google Colab: Processing data/prepping data due to lack of disk space on computers 
- Run python notebooks in Google Colab and upload them to GitHub after 

## Prepped the data 
- Renamed files and put them in folders accordingly 
- Noticed the shortest file is 55 seconds 
- Using first 45 seconds of songs and breaking it into 15 segments (3 second clips each) 
- Would do differently in the future 
  - Figure out the math of how we could use the entirety of each song while still maintaining the proportion of data for Beethoven and Other

## Figuring out training based on research  
- CNN 
  - Spectrograms 
- RNN 
  - MFCC 

## Training Approach
